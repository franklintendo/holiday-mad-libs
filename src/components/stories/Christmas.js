            <p>Jeffrey and <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nameMadLib}</span> <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.verbOne}</span> down a flight of stairs in anticipation of their Christmas presents. They huddled around the tree like a pair of <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.adjectiveOne}</span> <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nounFive}</span>. A gift for Jeffrey stood front and center. It looked like a <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nounTwo}</span> covered in wrapping paper.</p>

            <p>“That better not be a <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nounTwo}</span>” said Jeffrey.</p>

            <p>It was a <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nounTwo}</span>.</p>

            <p>“DAMN YOU, SANTA! DAMN YOUUUUU TO HELLLLLLLLL!” yelled Jeffrey. He shook his fists in anger toward the sky.</p>

            <p>The chimney started to rumble. The Christmas tree toppled over. Large cracks grew from the ceiling to the walls. <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nameMadLib}</span> began <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.verbTwo}</span>.</p>

            <p>Santa Claus appeared out of <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.adjectiveTwo}</span> air holding a gun that shoots coal. “Which one of you’s Jeffrey?”</p>

            <p>Jeffrey pointed to <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nameMadLib}</span>. Santa aimed his coal gun at <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nameMadLib}</span> and pulled the trigger. All that was left was a smoldering pair of size six Nike’s. Santa grabbed the <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nounTwo}</span> and handed it to Jeffrey. “Maybe you will appreciate this gift. Keep on rockin’ in the free world.”</p>

            <p>Santa put on his shades and walked into the sunset.</p>
