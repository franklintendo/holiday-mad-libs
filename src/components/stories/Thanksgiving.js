            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nameMadLib}’s</span> family grew impatient for Thanksgiving dinner. They started stomping their feet on the floor and banging their fists on the table with their utensils. <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nameMadLib}’s</span> little brother started <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.verbTwo}</span>.</p>

            <p>At last, <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nameMadLib}</span> brought out the main entrée: a <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nounOne}</span> on a plate.</p>

            <p>“What the hell is this?” asked <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nameMadLib}’s</span> father. “Where’s my <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.adjectiveOne}</span> turkey?”</p>

            <p>“I made <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nounOne}</span> instead of <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.adjectiveOne}</span> turkey this year,” responded <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nameMadLib}</span>. “It’s a lot healthier for you.” <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nameMadLib}</span> turned toward the youngest of the family. “If you eat <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nounOne}</span>, then you’ll grow up into a big and strong <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nounTwo}</span>!”</p>

            <p>The youngest of the family <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.verbOne}</span> his dinner plate into the family’s antique VCR. The whole family began throwing their plates on the ground. <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nameMadLib}’s</span> mother threw her valuable <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nounThree}</span> through the window. <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nameMadLib}’s</span> father started eating his collection of <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nounFive}</span> one by one. <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nameMadLib}’s</span> little brother took his <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>{madLibs.nounFour}</span> and launched it against the ceiling fan. The ceiling fan fell to the ground and burrowed itself deep into the Earth’s core.</p>

            <p>Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!</p>
